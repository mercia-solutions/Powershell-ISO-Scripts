# Powershell-ISO-Scripts
These are the PowerShell scripts used in our YouTube Demo to mount and unmount iso images. 
They are mounted to a folder so overcome the limitations of 26 drive letters

These scripts should work on Windows 10, Windows 11 and  Windows Server editions. 

This is a functional proof of concept and is by no means complete.

Please feedback any improvements / changes you make so it can be shared with everyone. 

If you need physical access to the disks a mechanical jukebox might be a better option - for more info visit us at https://mercia.solutions
